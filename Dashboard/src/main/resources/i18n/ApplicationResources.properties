terms.use.part.one= Content Provider Agreement\: forthwith referred to as the agreement. \nProject\: The Archives Portal Europe is the result of the APEnet project and will be developed further within the APEX project, the latter forthwith referred to as the project. \nContent providers\: for the duration of the project, the members of the project consortium as well as other legal entities accepted by the project as partners. \nHost\: for the duration of the project, MCU, which - as leader of the corresponding project workpackage - is responsible for building the required infrastructure of the Archives Portal Europe and for preparing its maintenance after the project''s lifetime. \nDashboard\: technical facility offering all functions for content providers for online use and tools for download and offline use. \nNational contact point\: archival or administrative institution responsible for the coordination of archival institutions participation to the project.
terms.use.part.two.title= Preamble 
terms.use.part.two= The Archives Portal Europe was created following an initiative of EBNA (the European Board of National Archivists), the Report on Archives in the enlarged European Union, the resolution on archives in the Member States (OJ 2003/C113/2) by the Council of the European Union, 6 May 2003, and the recommendation from 14 November 2005 of the Council on priority actions to increase cooperation in the field of archives in Europe (OJ 2005/L312/55). \nIts purpose is to enhance cross-border search and investigation in as well as publication of archival holdings across Europe by offering a joint publication platform for descriptive information to all European holders of archival material as described in the Report on Archives in the enlarged European Union.
terms.use.part.three.title= Article 1: Rights and obligations of the content providers
terms.use.part.three= 1. All European institutions responsible for archival material can use the portal for the publication of information on their holdings and their institutions, registered via the national contact point of their country. During the project, the national contact point of their country registers as a country manager and will grant other archival institutions access to the dashboard on their request. It is also possible for the national contact point to act on behalf of other archival institutions of their country, provided prior agreement on this exists between the institutions concerned, subject to notification of the host. Registered content providers obtain access to the dashboard and the tools provided by the project for the preparation of the data. \n2. The registration to the dashboard must be made by an authorised person acting as a representative or on behalf of the content provider. This person will not transfer the registration information to non-authorised persons or third parties. \n3. The content provider can upload, update, overwrite or delete content manually (via HTTP and FTP) or automatically (via OAI-PMH) whenever desired. The host provides the necessary technical interface through which the content provider has full control over his own data or the data that he manages on behalf of other institutions that he represents. The result of the deletion operation will be visible on the web presentation after the delay indicated. Any data that the content provider wants to have deleted will not be included in back-up operations and will be completely erased from the host server. \n4. The content provider can use the functionality provided by the host to automatically transfer selected data or all data to third parties. The host has no responsibility for the data delivered to third parties. Content providers also wishing to make their data available via Europeana will need to sign the special agreements provided for this purpose by Europeana and are recommended to act accordingly with regard to other third parties having separate agreements. The content provider can also stop the order of transferring data with the technical functionality provided by the host. The host has no responsibility whatsoever for data that already have been transferred by the content provider using the project''s tools. \n5. Each registered content provider is responsible for the legal accessibility of and the rights to re-use the data uploaded by himself to the Archives Portal Europe and optionally transferred to third parties using the technical functionality provided for this in the dashboard. No data transferred to the Archives Portal Europe can be re-used without the explicit authorisation of the content provider.
terms.use.part.four.title= Article 2: Rights and obligations of the host
terms.use.part.four= 1. The host operates the webservices of the Archives Portal Europe developed in accordance with the project and following the decisions of its governing bodies as well as the workpackage responsible for the development and maintenance of the portal infrastructure. \n2. The host is not entitled to use the data for purposes other than for the Archives Portal Europe and is not entitled to transfer the data to a third party on his own. Only the registered content provider is entitled to initiate such a transfer of data by using the corresponding function of the dashboard provided for this purpose. Any transfer of data to a third party as well as all communications concerning those data will be documented and notified to the content provider. \n3. The host guarantees that any conversion of data performed at the central dashboard conforms to the published rules and manuals. The host furthermore guarantees that the preview functionalities offered to evaluate how the data will be presented in the Archives Portal Europe accurately reflect the final display. \n4. The host will provide the content provider with the tool for processing the delivered data, including their complete deletion from the Archives Portal Europe. The host will not delete any data himself, since it will be the content providers only who will have to use this functionality.
terms.use.part.five.title= Article 3: Duration and termination of this agreement
terms.use.part.five= Termination of this agreement shall be provided in writing. It shall take effect on the date agreed by the parties. 
terms.use.part.six.title= Article 4: Modification of this agreement
terms.use.part.six= This agreement may be amended only by approval by the project''s consortium. No amendment of this agreement shall be binding unless it is in writing and conforms to the rules communicated by the Commission.
terms.use.part.seven.title= Article 5: Termination of rights
terms.use.part.seven= The rights granted both by the content provider to the host and by the host to the content provider end when either party terminates this agreement. Termination of this agreement will also end data transfer made by the host to third parties.
terms.use.part.eight.title= Article 6: Applicable law and jurisdiction
terms.use.part.eight= 1. This agreement is drawn up in English, which language shall govern all documents, notices, meetings, arbitral proceedings and processes relative thereto. This agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the terms of the European Union acts relevant to the project, the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Union and its Implementing Rules, other European Community and European Union law and, on a subsidiary basis, the law of Luxembourg. \n2. All disputes arising out of or in connection with this agreement which cannot be solved amicably, shall be referred to mediation. The outcome of the mediation process will be binding on the parties. The place of mediation shall be Luxembourg if not otherwise agreed by the conflicting parties. \n3. The project reserves its rights to take necessary mediating actions in case of disputes arise between constituent content providers f.i. due to unauthorised and/or controversial material being published or privacy regulations (in other countries) being violated. There will be a negotiation process started in such cases in which the project will advise to the content provider. In case of user complaints the host will refer them to the content provider concerned.
terms.use.part.nine.title= Article 7: Final clause
terms.use.part.nine= This agreement shall enter into force following the registration process as a content provider to the Archives Portal Europe on the day of the completion of this process.

terms.use.part.three.footer= 1. All European institutions responsible for archival material can use the portal for the publication of information on their holdings and their institutions, registered via the national contact point of their country. During the project, the national contact point of their country registers as a country manager and will grant other archival institutions access to the dashboard on their request. It is also possible for the national contact point to act on behalf of other archival institutions of their country, provided prior agreement on this exists between the institutions concerned, subject to notification of the host. Registered content providers obtain access to the dashboard and the tools provided by the project for the preparation of the data. <br> 2. The registration to the dashboard must be made by an authorised person acting as a representative or on behalf of the content provider. This person will not transfer the registration information to non-authorised persons or third parties. <br> 3. The content provider can upload, update, overwrite or delete content manually (via HTTP and FTP) or automatically (via OAI-PMH) whenever desired. The host provides the necessary technical interface through which the content provider has full control over his own data or the data that he manages on behalf of other institutions that he represents. The result of the deletion operation will be visible on the web presentation after the delay indicated. Any data that the content provider wants to have deleted will not be included in back-up operations and will be completely erased from the host server. <br> 4. The content provider can use the functionality provided by the host to automatically transfer selected data or all data to third parties. The host has no responsibility for the data delivered to third parties. Content providers also wishing to make their data available via Europeana will need to sign the special agreements provided for this purpose by Europeana and are recommended to act accordingly with regard to other third parties having separate agreements. The content provider can also stop the order of transferring data with the technical functionality provided by the host. The host has no responsibility whatsoever for data that already have been transferred by the content provider using the project''s tools. <br> 5. Each registered content provider is responsible for the legal accessibility of and the rights to re-use the data uploaded by himself to the Archives Portal Europe and optionally transferred to third parties using the technical functionality provided for this in the dashboard. No data transferred to the Archives Portal Europe can be re-used without the explicit authorisation of the content provider.

terms.use.part.four.footer= 1. The host operates the webservices of the Archives Portal Europe developed in accordance with the project and following the decisions of its governing bodies as well as the workpackage responsible for the development and maintenance of the portal infrastructure. <br> 2. The host is not entitled to use the data for purposes other than for the Archives Portal Europe and is not entitled to transfer the data to a third party on his own. Only the registered content provider is entitled to initiate such a transfer of data by using the corresponding function of the dashboard provided for this purpose. Any transfer of data to a third party as well as all communications concerning those data will be documented and notified to the content provider. <br> 3. The host guarantees that any conversion of data performed at the central dashboard conforms to the published rules and manuals. The host furthermore guarantees that the preview functionalities offered to evaluate how the data will be presented in the Archives Portal Europe accurately reflect the final display. <br> 4. The host will provide the content provider with the tool for processing the delivered data, including their complete deletion from the Archives Portal Europe. The host will not delete any data himself, since it will be the content providers only who will have to use this functionality.
