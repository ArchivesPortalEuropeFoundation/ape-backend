Any data that the content provider wants to have deleted will not be included in back-up operations and will be completely erased from the host server. \n4. The content provider can use the functionality provided by the host to automatically transfer selected data or all data to third parties. The host has no responsibility for the data delivered to third parties. Content providers also wishing to make their data available via Europeana will need to sign the special agreements provided for this purpose by Europeana and are recommended to act accordingly with regard to other third parties having separate agreements. The content provider can also stop the order of transferring data with the technical functionality provided by the host. The host has no responsibility whatsoever for data that already have been transferred by the content provider using the project''s tools. \n5. Each registered content provider is responsible for the legal accessibility of and the rights to re-use the data uploaded by himself to the Archives Portal Europe and optionally transferred to third parties using the technical functionality provided for this in the dashboard.
