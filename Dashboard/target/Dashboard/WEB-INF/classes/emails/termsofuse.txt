Preamble 

The Archives Portal Europe was created following an initiative of EBNA (the European Board of National Archivists), the Report on Archives in the enlarged European Union, the resolution on archives in the Member States (OJ 2003/C113/2) by the Council of the European Union, 6 May 2003, and the recommendation from 14 November 2005 of the Council on priority actions to increase cooperation in the field of archives in Europe (OJ 2005/L312/55). 
Its purpose is to enhance cross-border search and investigation in as well as publication of archival holdings across Europe by offering a joint publication platform for descriptive information to all European holders of archival material as described in the Report on Archives in the enlarged European Union.

Article 1: Rights and obligations of the content providers

1. All European institutions responsible for archival material can use the portal for the publication of information on their holdings and their institutions, registered via the national contact point of their country, to accomplish the figures of data estimation per country reflected in the project's Grant Agreement during its lifetime. During the project, the national contact point of their country registers as a country manager and will grant other archival institutions access to the dashboard on their request. It is also possible for the national contact point to act on behalf of other archival institutions of their country, provided prior agreement on this exists between the institutions concerned, subject to notification of the host. Registered content providers obtain access to the dashboard and the tools provided by the project for the preparation of the data. 
2. The registration to the dashboard must be made by an authorised person acting as a representative or on behalf of the content provider. This person will not transfer the registration information to non-authorised persons or third parties. 
3. The content provider can upload, update, overwrite or delete content manually (via HTTP and FTP) or automatically (via OAI-PMH) whenever desired. The host provides the necessary technical interface through which the content provider has full control over his own data or the data that he manages on behalf of other institutions that he represents. The result of the deletion operation will be visible on the web presentation after the delay indicated. Any data that the content provider wants to have deleted will not be included in back-up operations and will be completely erased from the host server. 
4. The content provider can use the functionality provided by the host to automatically transfer selected data or all data to third parties. The host has no responsibility for the data delivered to third parties. Content providers also wishing to make their data available via Europeana will need to sign the special agreements provided for this purpose by Europeana and are recommended to act accordingly with regard to other third parties having separate agreements. The content provider can also stop the order of transferring data with the technical functionality provided by the host. The host has no responsibility whatsoever for data that already have been transferred by the content provider using the dashboard. 
5. No data transferred to the Archives Portal Europe can be reused without the explicit authorisation of the content provider. Each registered content provider is responsible for the legal accessibility of and the rights to re-use the data uploaded by himself to the Archives Portal Europe and optionally transferred to third parties using the technical functionality provided for this in the dashboard.

3. The host operates the webservices of the Archives Portal Europe developed in accordance with the project and following the decisions of its governing bodies as well as the workpackage responsible for the development and maintenance of the portal infrastructure.

Only the registered content provider is entitled to initiate such a transfer of data by using the corresponding function of the dashboard provided for this purpose. Any transfer of data to a third party as well as all communications concerning those data will be documented and notified to the content provider. 
5. The host guarantees that any conversion of data performed at the central dashboard conforms to the published rules and manuals. The host furthermore guarantees that the preview functionalities offered to evaluate how the data will be presented in the Archives Portal Europe accurately reflect the final display. 
6. The host will provide the content provider with the tool for processing the delivered data, including their complete deletion from the Archives Portal Europe. The host will not delete any data himself, since it will be the content providers only who will have to use this functionality.
